###FLOWCHART
A flowchart is a graphical representation of a process or algorithm. It consists of different shapes and symbols that represent different actions or decisions in the process. The purpose of a flowchart is to help visualize the steps involved in a process or algorithm and to make it easier to understand and communicate.

###ONE_LINER : Flowchart can be considered an easier & faster way of explaining a code to someone who doesn't understands coding or is unaware of what that specific code does.

###ALGORITHM:

An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. It's a sequence of well-defined instructions that can be executed in a specific order to achieve a particular goal. Algorithms are essential in computer programming because they provide a way to structure and organize code.

### Why do we need them?
In C programming, you can use flowcharts and algorithms to plan out your code before you start writing it. Here are the steps to follow:

The same way in which you plan out your vacation before even reaching there. As in, if I'm planning a 4 day vacation to a city. 
1. I would list down all toursit places. 
2. I would plan in a way to cover all tourist places in 4 days. 
    For eg, if I have 12 places to cover,group them according to how close they are and
3. And align them according to day1, day2, ... day4.
4. And then book my accomodations, transportations accordingly
I would plan them as;
```CPP
Day 1: Tourist Place - 1,2,3
Day 2: Tourist Place - 4,5,6
.
.
Day 4: Tourist Place - 10,11,12
```  

Same way for a code we;

1. Start by `defining the problem` you're trying to solve or the task you're trying to accomplish.

2. `Break the problem down` into smaller, more manageable steps. Each step should be a clear and specific action that can be performed.

4. `Use flowchart symbols to represent each step` in the process. There are many different symbols you can use, but some of the most common ones include rectangles (for actions), diamonds (for decisions), and arrows (for flow).

5. `Connect the symbols` in the flowchart using arrows `to show the order` in which the steps should be performed.

Once you have a flowchart that represents the process or algorithm you want to implement, you can use it as a guide for writing your C code. Each symbol in the flowchart corresponds to a specific line or lines of code in your program.

Here's an example of a simple flowchart and algorithm in C:


###Problem: Find the sum of two numbers.

####Algorithm:
```CPP
Start
Declare variables num1, num2, and sum.
Read values of num1 and num2.
Add num1 and num2 and store the result in sum.
Display the value of sum.
Stop.
```
####Flowchart:

###Shape and its meanings

Oval      --> Start / End
Rectangle --> Action / operation / task  [If confusing relate it to a human action, say heart can be a variable [rhombus], but hearbeat is a process[rectangle]]
Diamond   --> Condition / Check  [Any condition that can have more than one outcome]
Rhombus --> Input / Output [Make note defining a variable must be done in square]
